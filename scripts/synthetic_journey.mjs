/**
 * Synthetic end-to-end check of the public demo — the detector half of the
 * watchdog loop (see .github/workflows/demo-watchdog.yml).
 *
 * WHY A REAL BROWSER, AND WHY THE REAL JOURNEY
 *
 * `keep-demo-warm.yml` already curls /health every 10 minutes, and on
 * 2026-08-04 it reported healthy throughout an outage that made the demo
 * completely unusable. It could not have caught it: curl is not a browser,
 * so it does not evaluate Content-Security-Policy, does not send an Origin
 * header, and does not enforce CORS. The failure lived entirely in those
 * layers. Everything a component check can see was fine.
 *
 * So this drives an actual Chromium instance through the actual first
 * thing a visitor does — load /bede/, click "Generate my code" — and
 * reports what a visitor would experience. It is the only check in this
 * repo that can fail for the reason a user would.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES IT MACHINE-ACTIONABLE
 *
 * It reads back the always-on diagnostics buffer (demo/src/diagnostics.ts)
 * via __bedeDebugEntries() and includes it in the report. That buffer is
 * what turns "it didn't work" into "connect-src blocked this exact URI",
 * which is the difference between a human having to investigate and an
 * agent being able to act. This script is the reason those diagnostics are
 * worth collecting at all in an unattended setting.
 *
 * SOFT DEPENDENCY: the diagnostics buffer it reads back is added by a
 * separate change (demo/src/diagnostics.ts). Without it the read simply
 * returns [] and every other signal here — CSP violations, failed
 * requests, response statuses, what the visitor saw — still works. The
 * buffer makes the report far more actionable; it is not required for it
 * to be useful.
 *
 * OUTPUT is JSON on stdout — one object, always, pass or fail — so the
 * workflow can hand it to an agent verbatim without scraping logs.
 *
 * PRIVACY: this is a synthetic session. The "student" is a fixed fake name
 * on a throwaway demo code, and nothing about a real family is read,
 * transmitted, or stored. The diagnostics it captures are its own.
 *
 * Usage:  node scripts/synthetic_journey.mjs https://agnusdei.ai/bede/
